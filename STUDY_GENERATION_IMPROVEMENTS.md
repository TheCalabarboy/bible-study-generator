# Study Generation Completeness Improvements

## Problem Identified

Some Bible study days were being truncated and not fully generated by Gemini, resulting in incomplete content missing key sections like Prayer Focus, Action Steps, or ending abruptly mid-sentence.

## Root Causes

1. **Token Output Limits**: Gemini's default output token limit was too low for generating 5 complete study days
2. **No Validation**: No checks to ensure studies were complete before returning them to the user
3. **Verbose Prompts**: Long prompts consumed input tokens, leaving less room for output
4. **No Retry Logic**: If generation was incomplete, there was no attempt to retry

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Increased Output Token Limit ✓

**File**: `geminiService.js:97-105`

```javascript
function getModel(config = {}) {
  return genAI.getGenerativeModel({
    model: MODEL_NAME,
    generationConfig: {
      maxOutputTokens: 8192, // Increased from default (~2048)
      ...config
    }
  });
}
```

**Impact**: Ensures Gemini has sufficient token budget to complete all 5 days

### 2. Study Completeness Validation ✓

**File**: `geminiService.js:57-118`

Added two validation functions:

#### `isStudyComplete(study)`
Checks if a single study day is complete by:
- Verifying minimum content length (>500 chars)
- Checking for required sections:
  - Introduction
  - Scripture Reading
  - Key Points
  - Questions (Reflection/Discussion/Family/Exploratory)
  - Prayer Focus
- Ensuring content doesn't end abruptly (last 5 lines must be >50 chars)

#### `validateStudiesCompleteness(studies)`
Validates the entire array:
- Confirms exactly 5 studies are present
- Checks each study for completeness
- Returns detailed validation result with indices of incomplete studies

### 3. Retry Logic with Validation ✓

**File**: `geminiService.js:468-519`

```javascript
let attempts = 0;
const maxValidationAttempts = 2;

while (attempts < maxValidationAttempts) {
  // Generate studies
  const parsed = JSON.parse(res.response.text());

  // Validate completeness
  const validation = validateStudiesCompleteness(parsed);

  if (validation.isValid) {
    return parsed; // Success!
  }

  // Log warning and retry if attempts remain
  console.warn(`✗ Validation failed: ${validation.message}`);
  if (attempts < maxValidationAttempts) {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  }
}
```

**Impact**: Automatically retries generation if studies are incomplete, with a 1-second delay between attempts

### 4. Streamlined Prompt ✓

**File**: `geminiService.js:383-438`

Reduced prompt from ~1200 tokens to ~600 tokens by:
- Removing verbose explanations
- Using bullet points instead of paragraphs
- Consolidating repeated instructions
- Keeping only essential context

**Impact**: Leaves more tokens available for output generation

### 5. Enhanced System Instructions ✓

Updated system instruction to explicitly require complete generation:

```javascript
systemInstruction: 'Produce precise, evidence-grounded studies. Output must be valid JSON according to the given schema. IMPORTANT: Complete ALL sections for ALL 5 days. Do not truncate content.'
```

## How It Works Now

### Generation Flow

1. **Request Generation**: Call Gemini with streamlined prompt and 8192 token limit
2. **Parse Response**: Extract JSON array of 5 studies
3. **Validate Completeness**:
   - Check that all 5 studies are present
   - Verify each study has required sections
   - Ensure content is not truncated
4. **Handle Result**:
   - ✓ **If valid**: Return studies to user
   - ✗ **If invalid**: Log warning, retry once (max 2 attempts)
   - ✗ **After 2 attempts**: Return what was generated with error logged

### Console Logging

The service now provides detailed logging:

```
Study generation attempt 1/2
✗ Validation failed: Studies 4, 5 appear incomplete or truncated
Retrying study generation due to incomplete content...
Study generation attempt 2/2
✓ All studies validated as complete
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

Test the improved generation with:

1. **Long sermons** (>45 minutes): Ensure all 5 days are complete
2. **Multiple options enabled**: Test with all options (memory verses, action steps, deeper analysis)
3. **Different usage profiles**: Test Personal Study, Small Group, Family Devotions, Sharing with Friends
4. **Edge cases**:
   - Very short input (minimal transcript)
   - Very long input (long sermon with lots of themes)
   - Rapid successive requests

### Expected Behavior

✓ **Before returning studies**: Console shows validation success
✓ **All sections present**: Each day has Introduction, Scripture Reading, Key Points, Questions, Prayer Focus
✓ **Proper endings**: No mid-sentence truncations
✓ **Consistent length**: Studies should be 1000-3000+ characters each

## Monitoring

Watch for these console messages:

- `Study generation attempt X/2` - Generation in progress
- `✓ All studies validated as complete` - Success
- `✗ Validation failed: ...` - Incomplete generation detected
- `Retrying study generation due to incomplete content...` - Retry in progress
- `Final attempt: Studies may be incomplete...` - Fallback after retries exhausted

## JSON Parsing Error Handling (Added)

### Problem: "Unterminated string in JSON" Error

When Gemini generates JSON with special characters, quotes, or newlines, the JSON can become malformed.

### Solution: Multi-Layer Error Recovery

**File**: `geminiService.js:440-558`

1. **Try direct parse** - Attempt to parse response as-is
2. **Cleanup & retry** - Remove markdown code blocks (```json```) and retry
3. **Validate format** - Ensure response is an array
4. **Auto-retry** - If parse fails, retry generation (up to 3 attempts)
5. **Error logging** - Log detailed error messages for debugging

```javascript
try {
  parsed = JSON.parse(responseText);
} catch (parseError) {
  // Clean up common issues
  responseText = responseText
    .replace(/```json\n?/g, '')
    .replace(/```\n?/g, '')
    .trim();

  // Retry parse
  parsed = JSON.parse(responseText);
}
```

### Enhanced Retry Logic

- Increased from 2 to **3 attempts**
- Added `temperature: 0.7` for more consistent output
- Variable retry delays: 1.5s for validation, 2s for errors
- Response preview logging for debugging

## Known Limitations

1. **Still possible to get incomplete studies**: After 3 attempts, incomplete studies may be returned rather than failing entirely (graceful degradation)
2. **No partial regeneration**: If only 1 study is incomplete, all 5 are regenerated (could be optimized)
3. **Validation is heuristic**: Checks for common patterns but may not catch all edge cases
4. **JSON schema enforcement**: While we use `responseSchema`, Gemini may still occasionally produce malformed JSON with special characters

## Future Improvements

Consider:
- **Streaming generation**: Generate one day at a time to reduce truncation risk
- **Progressive enhancement**: Show studies as they complete instead of all-or-nothing
- **User notification**: Display a warning message if incomplete studies are detected
- **Analytics**: Track completion rates to identify patterns
- **Day-specific regeneration**: Allow regenerating only incomplete days
